"""Secure deletion of a finalist's data (Act s.16, s.18(4)-(5); data protection review §4.5).

Everything held about one nomination is deleted in a single transaction: documents and their
extracted text and embeddings, claims and reviews, public-source findings, AI and human
ratings, ranking entries, calibration items, consents, and reports that contain the finalist.
Audit records about them are kept as events but their details are replaced with a redaction
marker, so the log still shows *that* things happened without saying *what* about whom.

Stored files are deleted after the transaction commits. Each file was encrypted with its own
data key held only in the file's header, so deleting the file destroys the key and the
ciphertext cannot be recovered ("crypto-shredding"). Copies in backups expire with the backups.

The immutability rules are bypassed only inside this transaction, via SET LOCAL wob.purge.
